    Quiz 3 - Nodejs
    20 pts.
-->

<!--
    1. (4pts) Assume this question is for a data.json file being used in a Node app.
    Create a JSON object below that has at least 5 properties and values related to a student.
    I.E. Name, GPA, Email, etc.

    { "fname":"Keanu", "lname":"Reeves", "age":55, "status":"Cool", "last-movie":"John Wick: Chapter 3 â€“ Parabellum" }
-->

<!--
    2. (5pts) This question is for a Utilities.js file.
    Write a module export that exports an object with 2 functions, one called read and one called write.
    The functions can just perform a console log, they do not need to do anything for now.

    module.exports = {
        read: function(){console.log("reading")};,
        write: function(){console.log("writing")};
    }
-->

<!--
    3. (6pts) Now update the read function in the Utilities.js file.
    This function must read the data from the data.json file into a sting.
    Then you must parse that string into an object variable.
    Then you must return that resulting object.


            read: function(){
                function callback(err, data) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    let data = JSON.parse(data);
                    console.log(data);
                }

                try{
                  fs.readFile("data.json", 'utf8', callback);
                } catch (err){
                    console.log(err);
                  }
            };

-->

<!--
    4. (5pts) Now we must setup the index.js file, write a module export that exports a self-firing function.
    Inside this function you need to create a var called utils and it must be the export of the Utilities file.

    module.exports = (function () {
        var utils = require('./Utilities')
    })();
